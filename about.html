I've been working in the Health Care for 18yrs but never felt it was for me. So 4 yrs ago I've made a decision to look for what I want, what I'm passionate about. I've look and tried to figures things out for my own. I knew that I want to be around in the computer. I went searching for computer class or bootcamp, and found TeamTreehouse. I know I want something to do building things in ground up and I was very intrigue of web developing. At first it was very difficult to focus learning HTML, CSS and JAvaScript and etc.
